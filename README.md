# Travel Tracker

Travel Tracker is a web application that allows users to sign in to view their personalized travel dashboard. A user's dashboard includes a scrollable div of all their trips--passed, upcoming, pending, and approved--with a few travel details about each adventure. Also seen on the dashboard are the total each user has spent on travel since the beginning of the current year (if they have traveled this year) and an option to book more adventures. Once submitted for review, the new trip request can be seen in the user's trip section.

## Deployment Link

Coming soon.

## Goals and Objectives:

- Conduct tests to check the functionality of the classes and methods
- Construct classes that instantiate and interact with each other
- Separate functionality and updates to the DOM for more understandable code
- Implement GET and POST API requests
- Iterate through large datasets and access nested properties
- Implement more of a responsive, UX/UI-friendly page design

## Technologies Used/ Contributors:

This travel application was written by [Francesca McConnell](https://github.com/mcfrann) while studying front-end development at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/).

Technologies/languages used include:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Mocha/Chai
- Moment.js
- Github / Github Projects
- VSCode

## Setup:

To access this project on your local machine, `git clone` this repo, `cd` into the folder, and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Go to the travel-tracker-api repo [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api). In a separate terminal tab, `git clone` this repo down to your machine in a different folder. `cd` into it then run `npm install`, then `npm start`. You now have access to the local server this project uses for its data.

Now you can go back to the terminal tab for this project and run `npm start`. Copy and paste the provided web address into your browser and the site should have full functionality! Alternatively, see the deployment link above.

To log in, any username of `traveler1` - `traveler50` will take you to different users' dashboards. Password is `traveler`.

## Wins:

- Being that this was my first solo project since learning about iterators and API calls, I was excited to see that I've truly absorbed the topics covered over the last mod and was able to apply them to this project both on my own and with the help of a couple of great cohort-mates with relative ease. This project truly showed me what I am capable of and I feel empowered in my ability to create beautiful and high-functioning webpages!
- The application of iterators to access nested data is starting to feel very natural and fun to me.

## Challenges:
- I ran into an issue with timing on this project as I didn't get a chance to begin the fourth iteration, completing an agent sign-in option/dashboard. I feel like as I continue my learning at Turing, my workflow will become more streamlined, however, I really wish I had gotten to this portion.
- Placement of event.preventDefault() is something that still seems confusing and foreign to me; I am hoping to understand this better come Mod 3.
- I am still learning how best for format my API calls and Promise.all() functions. What I've been implementing seems to work great, but I'm excited for my understanding of this area to deepen in the coming weeks.
